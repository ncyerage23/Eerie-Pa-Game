So, what's next for the editors?

We need to fix up the map builder and tile creator so there's some better functionality,
including variable size of maps and idk what else. Also if there's no texture, there needs
to be a default or something, like the minecraft missing texture

Entities are the next thing. Or objects, idk. Things the player can interact with.
Rocks, buildings, doors, etc. 

We need an editor for this, that will allow the user to assign properties to those entities. 
I'm not sure how that'll be done, but yeah. That's the next step. 

Then, a file for each map with its info, including background and all entities and their information

When that's done, I'm sure we'll need some major revisions to make it all work better. But then,
we need to build a way for the game to read it all and put it up on the screen for the game.
