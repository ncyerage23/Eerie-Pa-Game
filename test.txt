Notes for Eerie PA 2D Prototype


Maybe I should make a super simplistic version first? Idk. 

The Plan:
    Setup the main map
    Create the tile stuff for the environment
    Make a map editor to build the maps (just outside for now)

    Make the player
    Setup movement for the player within the map (just outside)

    Setup the buildings (the exteriors)
    setup the doors and letting the player enter buildings

    Get to npcs and that stuff
