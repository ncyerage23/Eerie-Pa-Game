So, here's what I'm going to be doing. I'm going to plan out how it'll all work,
then I'll start to build it piece by piece, you know? Keep it as simple as possible.

I'm not even sure how it's going to work, from the lowest level. Idek.

So, there's the outside world, and then different buildings you can enter.
The buildings are separate maps, and you can move around in them.
To enter the buildings, you walk up to the door and enter, and it removes the outside world
and plops you in that building.

I guess that's where I should start, right? Just a temp map of the whole town, and
a system for loading the map and moving around. 

I think it should be tile based, that seems like it'd be way easier for loading and stuff. Right? Yeah. 
Then, we can make a file for the outside map, maybe even a little map builder program, lol.
